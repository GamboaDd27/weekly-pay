After submitting the form, the page will redirect you to a table with the results

## Solution approach
The solution involves creating an Employee object for each entry in the input file, then the corresponding string is converted to a list of days with their own schedules. 

The payment for each day is determined by comparing the hours to a range of hours contained in a configuration file; schedules may overlap two or more different pay scales.

Once each day's wage is calculated, the weekly wage is computed and assigned as a field unique to each employee. 

Finally, the app dynamically renders a table detailing each employee's name and weekly wage.

The architecture of the solution is a simple Node.js web app that takes advantages of routing to communicate data between different JavaScript classes and to dynamically render the solution in a visual manner.
